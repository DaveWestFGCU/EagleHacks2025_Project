## Project Inspiration

Our project was inspired by a request from the company **Eightpoint** to develop a solution that uses AI API connections to generate personalized ads based on a keyword or search term. They specified that the generated text should include a title, description, and a call to action. Motivated by this challenge, we leveraged OpenAI's API to not only generate text but also create images based on this text.

By doing this, we are able to generate ads using AI that include titles, descriptions, and calls to action directly on the images, providing all-in-one ads ready for use.

## The API Workflow - From Keywords to Advertisement

Our API takes as little as a single keyword and turns it into 3 ad campaigns with a sample advertisement. To do this, we take a page out of how 'reasoning' AI models work: We prompt and re-prompt the AI, using its previous response to fill in next prompt in our pipeline. All text generation uses OpenAI's GPT 4o-mini model and images are generated by Dall-E 3.

1. **The Request**
   
   We start by receiving a request at the POST /new_job endpoint. The request requires a valid API key in the header, which is checked by middleware for all endpoints, as well as a form body with a product/service (aka keyword) for the ads. Optionally, the user can also provide an intended audience and a marketing goal.

   Additionally, an GET /job/{job_id} endpoint can be polled to get the current status of a given job.

2. **Creating a Campaign "Mood"**
   
    We begin our AI prompting pipeline by asking it to choose 3 concept categories that best represent the keyword. The categories are based on [marketing color theory](https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/psychology-of-color), and allow us to choose a color scheme for the advertisements that will align with its message for a cohesive campaign.
   
3. **Generating an Ad Campaign**
   
    At this point, the AdGenerator service develops 3 ad campaigns in parallel, based on each of the selected moods.
   
    The keyword, audience, goal, and mood, are inserted into a prompt asking the AI to generate details for an ad campaign consisting of a title, description, and key message. At this stage, we also ask it for details of what a potential image in an ad from this campaign would feature and what emotion it would intend to envoke in the viewer.

4. **Generating the Ad Copy**
   
   Next we use the campaign details generated in the previous step along with the terms in the mood category to create the highlight, body text, and call to action for a single advertisement in this campaign. The prompt includes ensuring the keyword is featured in each section.

5. **Generating the Ad Image**
    
   We then prompt an image generation AI model to create an image based on the keyword and audience, as well as the image details and emotion generated in step 3. We also ask that the image's color scheme reflect the campaign's "mood" color.

6. **Creating a Cohesive Advertisement**
    
   Finally, we take the ad copy and image and combine them in a template to create the final advertisement. The campaign's mood color is used for the highlight text color and the call to action's background color. Performing this step in a template ensures we have consistent results and is extensible, allowing for additional templates to be created.

7. **The Response**
    
    We now change the job's status to reflect that it is completed, move the job's directory into a mounted directory for hosting, and on the next query at the GET /job/{job_id}, respond with the new status and links to the ad PNG images.
